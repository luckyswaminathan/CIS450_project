# Project Description

When politicians of a particular party tweet, it stands to reason that they are providing signal about what sort of words, topics, ideas, etc. are relevant to their party’s views, and, more importantly, to their constituency. Our goal with this project is to blend this assumption with a massive dataset of tweets gathered from the heated political discourse occuring in the weeks preceding and including the 2020 presidential election. By bucketing tweets into topics, analyzing their sentiment, and scoring their bias against ‘true’ scores for tweets made by partisan representatives, we gained three critical features with which to study how and what Twitter/X users are talking about across state and political lines. These allow us to make insights that are crucial for anyone involved in the electoral process, from campaign teams to policymakers, as it provides them with valuable information to better connect with voters and consequently influence election outcomes.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
